I chose "Paris Accord" as a topic because people from around the world have opinions on the topic, especially since Trump pulled out, and because there's a lot of room for people who don't know shit about shit to talk about it, so going to reputable sources like newspapers where there's been some vetting, even if you're finding opinion pieces, is a great use case for PressReader.

This will probably work best if we've already shown how to access PressReader, but that could wait for a live demo after the slides or something.

## Goals:

1. Show how to search in PressReader
2. Show how to spot signifiers like the newspaper source and byline of an author from the search results as an aid to reading diversely.
3. Show how the page view helps add context to a story (seeing it's on the Opinion Page or what have you).

## Headlines 

A bunch of headlines that come up when we search in PressReader for Paris Accord. PR-ParisAcc-01-Headlines.png

On this screen we can point out how to see which news source the headlines are coming from.

Globe and Mail has 3 versions of the same story. Clicking through shows it's about Trudeau and Merkel PR-ParisAcc-02-GM.png If you look at the Hamilton Spectator story PR-ParisAcc-03-HamSpec.png you see it's written by a different person, but has a similar point of view. This is what the Canadian federal government is concerned with about the Paris Accord right now.

## Opinion

One thing is that the big news about the Paris Accord, Trump pulling the US out of it, happened more than a week ago so the factual news about that is a bit thin on the ground. The Canadian newspapers are reporting on fallout of other aspects of the story that are specifically Canadian. Most of the stories about the Paris Accord are going to be opinion pieces reacting to the news, giving readers perspective/telling them what the writer thinks about the news. This is the same stuff a lot of independent writers and bloggers do too, but the sources in PressReader are larger and generally have a bit more money to not just spew random thoughts on a subject.

## Letters to the Editor

So if we're looking to read widely, let's see what the reaction looks like in other places. There are a few headlines here from the Atlanta Journal Constitution, so if we click on one of them because it mentions Neil deGrasse Tyson ("Leaving Paris Accord a major error") we get a short article. This is where looking at the page view is really important. PR-ParisAcc-04-Atlanta.png Now we can see this isn't an article at all, but a letter to the editor in the Readers Write section. This is clearly an opinion page, and we can see the organization Anne Mellinger-Birdsong represents (Mothers and Others for Clean Air). This doesn't mean what she's saying isn't valid, but it's a different kind of story than those reports. Also on this page you can see a differing opinion on the Paris Accord by someone who we have no idea if he knows what he's talking about. This page is the equivalent of blog posts by people who may or may not be informed.

## Editorial

If we try another article from further afield in the world we're getting a sense of other perspectives. PR-ParisAcc-05-SriLanka.png The Trump crushes Paris bloom article uses a lot of strong language and is very long (too long to fit on one screen). Again, if we go to the Page View mode PR-ParisAcc-05-SriLankaPageView.png we can see that this comes from the Comment section of the paper and has no byline. This means it's an editorial written "by the paper" stating the organization's views. It is an opinion piece. Do you trust the editors of a newspaper in Sri Lanka more than you trust a random North American blogger? That is up to you.

## Expert Commentary

Lastly, what if we look at an international story from another island nation? The So What if US pulls out of Paris Accord PR-ParisAcc-06-Jamaica.png comes from Jamaica. Again, checking the page view gives us more context to the article. PR-ParisAcc-06-JamaicaPageView.png At the bottom of the article we can see that the writer of this piece "Jamaican ambassador Byron W. Blake was G-77 and China lead negotiator on sustainable development and climate change in 2005 and 2008." Again, you can go further down the rabbit hole on what kind of expertise that means he has, but I'd argue that he is talking from a different perspective than landlocked Alberta and those credentials and experience imply he's got some useful perspective.
