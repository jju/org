# County Collaboration Software meeting

- strip out the local hall channels
- who will be the mdoerators? admins?
- first person in only one to see notifications if we go shared accounts
- goals:
	1. inter hall communication:
		- best case use for Slack, especially if shared accounts
	2. intra hall communication:
		- handled by private channels or direct messaging self
- calendar planning desired but can't really work in Slack
- JU will be handling the training:
	- shared account oddities, checking for new messages etc
	- uploading files
	- finding files
	- asking questions of other halls
	- clarifying that slack is not primarily a collaboration on a document space, nor a calendar replacement tool
