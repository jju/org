# County Collaboration Software meeting

- [X] strip out the local hall channels
- who will be the mdoerators? admins?:
	- slack has Owners, Admins, Members
	- no real way to force someone to change a password
	- admins can delete files and channels
- first person in only one to see notifications if we go shared accounts
- goals:
	1. inter hall communication:
		- best case use for Slack, especially if shared accounts
	2. intra hall communication:
		- handled by private channels or direct messaging self
- calendar planning desired but can't really work in Slack
- :JU: will be handling the training:
	- shared account oddities, checking for new messages etc
	- uploading files
	- finding files
	- asking questions of other halls
	- clarifying that slack is not primarily a collaboration on a document space, nor a calendar replacement tool
	- can use Posts that anyone can edit as rudimentary schedule figuring out tool the way :DB: wanted
