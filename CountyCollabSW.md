# Slack

Slack is software for helping people communicate and organize. It's like a chatroom or a bulletin board where people can post messages and ask questions, and post documents that would be helpful for others.

Individuals can connect to the Slack page and access it through their web browser. They can also install an app on their tablet/phone/or computer. Our test version here is strathconacountytest.slack.com

We could possibly create "community accounts" so North Cooking Lake would have a common login for people who didn't want to sign up individually.

Channels are ways of focusing the conversation in Slack.

Files can be uploaded or shared from different cloud storage or directly from a device.

One of the nice things about slack is that if someone asks "Where can I get godzilla-proof fencing?" in a channel and someone shares a great answer, that answer will show up when down the line someone else searches for "godzilla" and the solution can be shared.

here one product that could work - with a few examples to help you imaging using it - what do you think, and is there anything else you would find useful

# matching up with County's Community Halls Volunteer Boards Collaboration Sites opportunity assessment

meeting with SN, SS, SC 2017-06-12

## 1.4 Current Situation/Business Problem

Currently, the Community Hall Boards are not known to be using any specific or standard software though they are likely using emails, texting, and other solutions. What they need is an all-in-one, or as close as possible, to provide the ability to add, edit, share and comment on:

1)Calendars and Scheduling - Slack does not handle this, can integrate with other tools.
2)Document & Image Sharing and Collaboration - Slack can handle Document/Image sharing within Slack, but is more focused on final versions than actual collaboration on living documents (a la Google Drive). Also it is not designed as a publicity tool, so sharing out from Slack to public facing promo areas requires a bit of work.
3)Meetings - Slack handles live group chat well and would work for remote meetings.
4)Communications - Slack is primarily a communication tool and would work well for this provided the channels are set up in an intuitive way for the county hall groups
5)Mobile device compatible - Slack has iOS, Android and Windows 10 apps.
6)Security access and permissions - Slack requires an invited login to join an instance (in this case something like Strathcona County Halls Space). Within Slack certain channels can be set as private/invitation only.

No integration to County network is required.

Alternative: Google Suite of Apps - gmail, hangouts, calendars, drive, docs, sheets, slides
