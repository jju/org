# First step:

assessment by department

# walk through current process

* what is your department's assigning/requesting shifts procedure (recurring routines; priorities for shifts; lead time; integrating with payroll; granularity of tasks/locations)
 * how often does it change once a schedule has been set? just for sick days? what's the process for covering when someone isn't here?
 * how long does this take (weekly? monthly? daily?)
 * is this covering your needs?

## MMIT

MMIT split into Materials Management's regular shift people (9-5 M-F) and the techs, who use [When To Work][w2w].

* MM just put their away shift requests in the Shelf's Away calendar for Vacation requests -> manually brought into Outlook
> the rest of this will be dealing with the techs only

### [When To Work software][w2w]

> Currently used by MMIT & CS
> * we have the 31-60 license level which is ~ $433USD/yr
> * to cover all of SCL we'd need to get up to 150 licenses ~ $550USD/yr

* SN & BD are admins
  * SN logs in (browser-based) usually on Mondays to do the scheduling
  * Template weekly schedule to import, and then updates it as necessary.
  * When the schedule is published, the techs get emails to notify them of their scheduled shifts (and then they get emails afterwards if a published shift is modified).
  * MMIT doesn't use much automation
    - Names each shift individually: morning, afternoon, evening, FSPL
    - SN manually chooses colours of shifts
    - only 1 "position" Techs -> which could possibly map to desk locations
    - checks binder for how many hours a PT employee gets for a stat holiday
    - doesn't integrate with timesheets for payroll
  * setting up staff with max hours/days and preferences
  * SN tries to do it a couple of weeks ahead of time, but not further so as to remain flexible
  * watch the tally to make sure the numbers even out for each person
  * when complete, the schedule gets printed off and posted on MMIT's door
  * requests for time off come to SN's Outlook and she inputs them in w2w? > this may be wrong - there's a pending requests tab on the page that she can deal with
> holding bin in the software for unassigned shifts - may mean we can put programs in there ahead of time
> doesn't seem to be a batch-change of shifts option

## CS

Three different kinds of scheduling in CS:

1. JD managers / front desk
2. LM sorter room
3. BK pages

JD uses [When To Work][w2w] least. Does the scheduling in Excel and then transfers shifts to another Excel file to print and display (this is the authoritative version), then inputs shifts into w2w just for the email notifications.

LM uses templates in w2w each week, putting what needs coverage in the unassigned shifts bin and then moving them to the right people. Done in 4 hour chunks. This is just used for the on or off-ness of shifts.

BK does a daily schedule with hourly breakdown of tasks for pages, uses codes the pages know for shelving or shelfreading or whatevs

generally no specification of locations where people are working, if necessary a note in the description field in W2W

Every month. AMK asks for schedule requests by email. This covers programs, meetings time off. She puts them into an excel sheet. Figures out desk coverage. Counts up hours by hand for trying to keep things even as far as weekend evenings and such. This takes hours.

A week or two ahead of time SF creates the weekly desk schedule for AS & YS. I don't know how the desk schedule is coordinated between AS & YS.

TL checks everyone's Outlook calendars for their programs, tours, meetings and such. Puts them into a spreadsheet. Figures out desk coverage based on who isn't in a program or meeting. Counts up hours (by hand?) trying to keep things even as far as weekend evenings and such.

There's a paper calendar where people highlight vacation days. A bit of discussion within groups.

# analysis of existing data

## MMIT

* haven't needed to analyze data yet, but there are summary and detailed reports that can be printed/downloaded
  * knowing who's in the building at any given time is important
  * can import individual's weekly schedule as vcs into Outlook (also GCal option)

## CS

* track extra hours because of the need to call in for people, but mostly on the budget/finance side of things
  * Friday evening rotation, Weekend rotation
  * BK colour codes weekend shifts in excel, JD writes last date of weekending in a row in an excel sheet
  * LM schedules sorter room stat holidays a year in advance

# what do you want out of scheduling software?

* do you like a graphical interface or tables and forms?
  * what types of activities happen in your department?
  * are there specific locations that need to be noted?
  * do people need to swap shifts with or without managerial intervention?
  * what about future changes in the department? anything on the horizon?

## MMIT

* SN really appreciates w2w's drag and drop of shifts
  * would like the swap board to be used more

## CS

* can't see two-week pay period in one w2w view, leads to hassles, and is why JD doesn't use it
  * otherwise things are going fine
  * shift swapping board is used
