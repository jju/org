# When2Work Assessment

- blocks of shifts, can set ahead of time and reuse
- shiftswapping board
- no built in "locations" but possible to set it up that way by scheduler
- no overlap possible so this goes to AMK's scheduling of deskness and programs being the key thing to do

## summary

- w2w will require a bit of finagling to cover all of AS/YS' needs but it allows the flexibility they need
- the departments that don't like to use software can get away with minimal implementation, but if we're going this route I'd recommend all departments use it so you can pull out comparable information.
