Bob Holmes' Flavor is a popular science book about the sense we use that's one of the hardest to put into words. Holmes has interviewed scientists working on taste, smell, neuropsychology, genetics, soil composition, molecular gastronomy (and more) to really get into what we mean when we talk about how things taste, because it's far more complicated than those old four-taste tongue diagrams you might remember. One of the big takeaways from the book is that the difference between professional tasters (like wine-experts) and amateurs is more about the attention they pay  and the vocabulary they have practised with than anything specific in their tongues. It's written in a light humorous fashion and though I would have liked a bit more in-depth explanation on a few points (how do we know a nerve is transmitting at maximum intensity?) this definitely provided enough facts to make me a bit of an insufferable dining companion.
