# Schedule3W Assessment

- allows concurrent chifts with split of locations Work and Desk/Program/Location
- requires Work shifts to be scheduled before putting a staffmember in a specific location
- database lives on one of our computers, can be made accessible if the db is stored on a webserver
- put in default schedule and it extends forward, but then scheduler has to go in and manipulate things
- includes settings to define unpaid lunch breaks

## summary

- granular control -> would give good data
- can set required staffing levels and show when we don't have them
- complicated, windows software, test version crashes a lot
