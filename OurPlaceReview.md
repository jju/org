Kevin Van Tighem has written about Alberta's environment, and his concern for it, for over thirty years. Our Place is a collection of those heartfelt, thoughtful, researched essays. The book is organized by themes so you get fishing pieces together, and hunting ones together, and the whole idea of segmenting up something that is large and whole get put together. This approach means the footnotes can get a little sad, especially when you read a hopeful essay from the 1980s where the hope didn't really work out. I'm not a hunter or a fisher, but he writes evocatively about those practices and the attention they reward. What I appreciated most about the book was Van Tighem's sense of the connectedness of all things and how attention and language matters, and how natural gas and tar sands exploitation is costing Albertans their souls.
